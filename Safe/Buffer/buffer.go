// Buffer is a thread-safe, generic data structure that allows multiple
// goroutines to produce and consume elements in a synchronized manner.
// It is implemented as a queue and uses channels to synchronize the
// goroutines.
// The Buffer should be initialized with the Init method before use.

// Parameters:
//   - bufferSize: The size of the buffer for the send and receive channels.
//     Must be a non-negative integer. If a negative integer is provided,
//     the method will panic with an *ers.InvalidParameterError.

// Returns:
//   - *Buffer: A pointer to the newly created Buffer instance.
//   - error: An error of type *ers.InvalidParameterError if
//     the buffer size is negative.
//
// Information: To close the buffer, just close the send-only channel.
// Once that is done, a cascade of events will happen:
//   - The goroutine that listens for incoming messages will stop listening
//     and exit.
//   - The goroutine that sends messages from the Buffer to the receive
//     channel will stop sending messages once the Buffer is empty, and then exit.
//   - The Buffer will be cleaned up.
//
// Of course, a Close method is also provided to manually close the Buffer but
// it is not necessary to call it if the send-only channel is closed.
