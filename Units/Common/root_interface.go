package Interfaces

// Comparable is an interface that defines the behavior of a type that can be
// compared with other values of the same type using the < and > operators.
// The interface is implemented by the built-in types int, int8, int16, int32,
// int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, float32, float64, and string.
type Comparable interface {
	~int | ~int8 | ~int16 | ~int32 | ~int64 | ~uint | ~uint8 | ~uint16 | ~uint32 | ~uint64 |
		~float32 | ~float64 | ~string
}
